# MATLAB-projects
This repository contins a few MATLAB projects and subsequent writeups in k-means clustering, dynamic systems modeling, feature engineering and neural networks.

**K-means classiying:** A case study aimed at successully clustering COVID data into different locations in order to predict the origin of the data.

**Dynamic systems modeling:** This project uses the SIRD (succeptable-infectied-recovered-dead) model to simulate the spread of COVID-19. The goal was to tune model parameters and simulate real-world scenarios based on historical data.

**Feature engineering:** This case study focuses on feature engineering digit images from the MNIST data set. This involved pplying a least-squares method to create an accurate weight vector for classification.

**Neural networks:** Similar to feature enginerring, this project classifies MNIST digit images, but through the use of a neural network. It contrasts the feature engineering progect by automating the learning of features.
