# MATLAB-projects
This repository contins a few MATLAB projects and subsequent writeups in k-means clustering, dynamic systems modeling, feature engineering and neural networks.

## Projects
### **[K-means classiying:](https://github.com/rfandozzi/MATLAB-projects/tree/rfandozzi-k-means.git)** A case study aimed at successully clustering COVID data into different locations in order to predict the origin of the data.

### **[Dynamic systems modeling:](https://github.com/rfandozzi/MATLAB-projects/tree/rfandozzi-dynamic-systems-modeling.git)** This project uses the SIRD (succeptable-infectied-recovered-dead) model to simulate the spread of COVID-19. The goal was to tune model parameters and simulate real-world scenarios based on historical data.

### **[Feature engineering:](https://github.com/rfandozzi/MATLAB-projects/tree/feature-engineering.git)** This case study focuses on feature engineering digit images from the MNIST data set. This involved pplying a least-squares method to create an accurate weight vector for classification.

### **[Neural networks:]** Similar to feature enginerring, this project classifies MNIST digit images, but through the use of a neural network. It contrasts the feature engineering progect by automating the learning of features.
